2. Find the Encrypted Key

The key is encrypted and stored in the Local State file. You can extract this key using the following steps:
Extracting the Encrypted Key:

    Open Local State File

    Open the Local State file using a text editor like Notepad or a JSON viewer. It is located at:

    sql

C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Local State

Locate the Encrypted Key

Search for the os_crypt section in the JSON content. Look for encrypted_key. It will look something like this:

json

    {
      "os_crypt": {
        "encrypted_key": "<Your Encrypted Key Here>"
      }
    }

    Copy the Encrypted Key

    Copy the value of encrypted_key. It will be a long base64-encoded string.

3. Decrypt the Key

To decrypt the encrypted key, you will need to decode and decrypt it using the Windows DPAPI (Data Protection API). This usually requires specific tools or scripts. For this, you can use Python with pywin32 or tools like dpapick if you are working in an environment like Kali Linux.

Hereâ€™s how you can handle it in Python:
Python Script to Decrypt Key

You might use a script like the one below to decrypt the key:

    Install Required Packages:

    Install pywin32 to handle DPAPI decryption:

    sh

pip install pywin32

Python Script:

Create a Python script to decrypt the key:

python

    import base64
    import win32crypt

    def decrypt_key(encrypted_key_base64):
        # Decode base64
        encrypted_key = base64.b64decode(encrypted_key_base64)
        
        # Remove the 'DPAPI' header (first 5 bytes)
        encrypted_key = encrypted_key[5:]
        
        # Decrypt using DPAPI
        decrypted_key = win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData(encrypted_key, None, None, None, 0)[1]
        return decrypted_key

    # Replace this with your actual base64 encoded encrypted key
    encrypted_key_base64 = "<Your Encrypted Key Here>"

    decrypted_key = decrypt_key(encrypted_key_base64)
    print("Decrypted Key:", decrypted_key)

    Run the Script:

    Replace <Your Encrypted Key Here> with the base64 string you copied earlier and run the script on a Windows machine.

4. Use the Decrypted Key

Once you have the decrypted key, you can use it to decrypt the passwords stored in the Login Data file. This usually involves reading the SQLite database file and decrypting the passwords using the key you obtained.
Summary

    Extract the Local State file from the Chrome user data directory.
    Get the encrypted key from the Local State file.
    Decrypt the key using a script or tool.
    Use the decrypted key to decrypt passwords from the Login Data file.
